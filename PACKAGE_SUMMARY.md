## 🎓 Key Calculations

### BMI
```
BMI = (Weight kg) / (Height cm)² × 10,000
```

### Daily Calorie Target
```
Base = 2,000-2,600 depending on current BMI
Adjustment = Goal-specific (deficit, surplus, or maintenance)
```

### Weight Loss Timeline
```
Days Needed = (Weight to Lose × 7,700) / (Daily Deficit)
Example: 10kg at 500 cal/day deficit = ~154 days = ~5 months
```
