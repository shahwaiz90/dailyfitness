- **Remaining Calories** = Target - Net Calories
- Your target is automatically calculated for your goal

### Track Consistently
The GitHub-style graph shows your consistency. Try to log something every day!

### Use Realistic Calorie Estimates
- For food: Check labels or estimate (google: "calories in [food]")
- For exercise: Use fitness watches or online calculators

### Weight Logging
- Log once per day at the same time (morning recommended)
- Don't obsess over daily changes - look at weekly trends
- Weight fluctuates due to water, food volume, etc.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Data is Local** - Your data stays on your device. No cloud backup.
   - Back up by exporting or saving the localStorage data
   
2. **Browser Matters** - Different browsers have separate localStorage
   - Use the same browser for consistent data
   
3. **Clear Browser Data** - Don't clear browser cache or you'll lose data!
   - If needed, use the "Reset Profile" button instead

4. **Calorie Accuracy** - Estimates aren't perfect
   - Be consistent with your tracking
   - Focus on trends, not daily perfection
