- ❌ **Data is UNENCRYPTED** - stored in plain text
- ❌ **NO user authentication** - anyone with browser access sees all data
- ❌ **NO HIPAA/GDPR compliance** - not for regulated use
- ❌ **NOT designed for scale** - impossible to serve millions
- ❌ **NO multi-user support** - single-user only
- ❌ **NO backup system** - clearing cache = permanent loss

### What You CAN Use It For:
- ✅ Personal fitness tracking on your own device
- ✅ Individual self-improvement projects
- ✅ Learning and educational purposes
- ✅ Hobby projects
- ✅ Personal experimentation

### What You CANNOT Use It For:
- ❌ Sharing with friends/family (no authentication)
- ❌ Commercial applications
- ❌ Storing others' health data
- ❌ Regulated industries (healthcare, finance)
- ❌ Multi-user environments
- ❌ Any production deployment
- ❌ Any use beyond personal single-user tracking

**If you violate these limitations, you are responsible for:**
